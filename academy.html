<h3>Phase I – Orientation & Basics</h3>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Phase I introduces cadets to department structure, expectations,
    professionalism, and basic law enforcement responsibilities.
    This phase is completed in the academy classroom after uniforms
    are issued. The primary focus is the cadet reference sheet and
    radio communication.

  <p>
    Once all cadets are together, walk them to the clothing room.
    You can copy and paste the codes below into <strong>#awaiting-academy</strong>
    for them to use when importing outfits.
  </p>

  <ul style="text-align:left;">

  <h2>Cadet Reference Sheet</h2>

  <p>
    In this section, post the vLife PD Roster Sheet in
    <strong>#awaiting-academy</strong>. Have everyone open it and navigate
    to the Cadet Reference Sheet section. Go through each topic listed
    below and explain them. Let cadets know this sheet should be their
    first reference before asking questions.
  </p>

  <ul style="text-align:left;">
    <li>Basic commonly used 10-codes</li>
    <li>Miranda Rights</li>
    <li>Code 5 Felony Stop</li>
    <li>10-80 rules</li>
    <li>10-70 rules</li>
    <li>Probable Cause</li>
    <li>Reasonable Suspicion</li>
    <li>Calling a traffic stop</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Callsigns & Log</h2>

  <p>
    This portion is very simple. Have everyone go to
    <strong>#awaiting-academy</strong> and post their first and last name.
    Then go to <strong>#academy-log</strong>, copy the log template, and fill
    it out for each cadet. Check the previous log to determine the next
    available callsign—those will be their assigned callsigns.
    <br><br>
    Once completed, issue each cadet a radio on the way to the garage
    and have them join radio channel <strong>#85</strong>. Walk them through
    enabling the radio overlay and updating their radio name with their
    rank and callsign.
