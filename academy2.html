<h3>Phase II – Traffic Stop Training</h3>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Phase II focuses on proper radio communication during traffic stops
    and applying classroom knowledge in real-world scenarios. This phase
    ensures cadets are fluent and confident when conducting traffic stops,
    Code 5 stops, and pursuits. All training is conducted in the open area
    behind the PD garage.

  <h2>Physical Traffic Stop</h2>

  <p>
    Use a personal civilian vehicle as the vehicle being stopped.
    Position your marked patrol vehicle behind it in the proper traffic
    stop position. Explain positioning and safety considerations to the
    cadets. Once demonstrated, have each cadet individually call out a
    traffic stop over the radio. After all cadets are confident and smooth,
    proceed to the next exercise.

  <h2>Physical Code 5 Stop</h2>

  <p>
    Have each cadet, one at a time, properly dispatch a Code 5 stop.
    Train cadets on safely removing suspects one at a time and explain
    proper vehicle positioning using the diamond formation. Emphasize
    officer safety and clear communication throughout the stop.

  <h2>Physical Vehicle Pursuit</h2>

  <p>
    This exercise can become intense, especially with multiple cadets,
    so run it one cadet at a time. One cadet should drive the civilian
    vehicle, while the remaining cadets ride in PD-issued vehicles.
    The instructor should sit in the front passenger seat.
    Conduct the pursuit near the docks by the oil rig job site.
    Ensure proper pursuit dispatch is maintained. Rotate cadets through
    the driver position until each demonstrates confidence and control
    before moving on.

  <h2>Physical Foot Pursuit</h2>

  <p>
    While still at the docks, conduct a controlled foot pursuit scenario.
    Ensure cadets wait at least 15 seconds between taser deployments and
    verbally announce “Taser, Taser, Taser” prior to use. Cadets must
    provide clear suspect descriptions, direction of travel, and confirm
    that postols may be announced over the radio during foot pursuits.
